# Project Overview

In this project a web-based application that reads RSS feeds is given. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. 

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." In this project, we wrote some tests against a pre-existing application that will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How to Run the Application

1. First you have to download or clone this repository.

2. Find the `index.html` file, and open the file with your favorite browser.

3.  Jasmine tests will be displayed at the bottom of the index.html page. 

4. Open the `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` file if you want to edit test suites.

 Review the [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io) if you're not familiar with it.
